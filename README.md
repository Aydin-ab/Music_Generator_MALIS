# Music_Generator_MALIS
School project for the MALIS course about generating music with Machine Learning

In the "app" folder :
- "NeuralNetwork.py" has the model of our neural network with the definition of our loss, accuracy, backpropagation etc. It comes from the lab 2
- "main.py" is the file to run to use our generator
- "pickles" contains pickle files that saves the neural network model and makes it persistent. So we don't have to create the same model every time we run "main.py"
- "test.py" is a copy of "main.py" if you want to experiment some changes in the code

Don't forget to adapt the path variables to your computer, specially for the input MIDI file and the output MIDI file at the beggining of the "main.py" code AND the pickle files path later in the code
